# CONNECT Dashboard

Data and graphics, interactive dashboard for the CONNECT Project

### Includes:
- gulp tasks for compiling sass and building angular project file from modularized file structure
- fixed header and footer

### Getting started

NPM is used to manage front-end dependencies.

```npm install``` will do the trick

There are a few basic gulp commands specified for getting started.

```gulp js``` and ```gulp sass``` will build/compile the angular and sass files respectively.

The default gulp command ```gulp``` will launch a local dev server that will serve ```index.html```
up at ```localhost:8080``` or ```0.0.0.0:8080```. It will also watch your ```sass``` and ```js```
directories and will recompile/rebuild files as needed.
